👋 Hi, I’m @InformalLogicACO, but you can call me Michael!

👀 I’m into all things related to technical informatics, from writing code and breaking down complex systems to exploring the intricacies of secure communications. I love diving into technical details and solving interesting challenges.

🌱 I’m constantly learning new programming languages and methods to enhance my knowledge across various fields of tech, always staying curious and open to new ideas.

💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on innovative projects, whether it’s secure coding practices, software development, or anything that pushes the boundaries of technical exploration. If you have an exciting idea, feel free to reach out!

📫 You can get in touch with me through my GitHub profile.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I’m a huge fan of solving puzzles, especially the ones that challenge both my logical thinking and coding skills!

The projects here are small and varied. They serve as a way to showcase and share interesting ideas with friends and collaborators.
If you find a bug, let me know! I’m always happy to fix it when I have the time. Collaboration is always welcome, so if you have any requests or ideas, feel free to connect, and we can code together.

May the logic be with you!

-Michael aka IL
