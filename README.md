👋 Hi, I’m @InformalLogicACO, but you can call me Michael!
👀 I’m deeply passionate about cryptography, IT security, and all things related to technical informatics. Whether it's writing code, breaking down complex systems, or exploring the intricacies of secure communications, I love diving into the technical details.
🌱 I’m constantly learning new programming languages, security protocols, and methods to enhance my knowledge in cryptography and system security.
💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on innovative projects related to IT security, secure coding practices, or anything that pushes the boundaries of technical informatics. If you have an exciting idea, feel free to reach out!
📫 You can get in touch with me through my GitHub profile.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him


⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of solving puzzles, especially the ones that challenge both my logical thinking and coding skills!

The projects here are small and not always related to IT security. They are more to showcase and share some projects with friends and collaborators.

If you find a bug, let me know! I'm always happy to fix it if I have the time. Collaboration is always welcome, so if you have any requests or ideas, feel free to connect, and we can code together.

May the logic be with you!
